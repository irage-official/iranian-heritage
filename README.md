The **Irage** (Iranian Heritage) is a community-built, independent calendar app created by people who believe in Iran — the real Iran.
Not the version rewritten by the Islamic Republic regime, but the Iran of ancient pride, culture, identity, and freedom.

We are the first Iranian nationalist calendar app with zero connection to the Islamic Republic.
* No sponsorship
* No political ties
* No propaganda
Just pure love for our homeland and a commitment to tell the truth. 

This project brings together two powerful stories:

⭐ 1. Our Heritage
The festivals, traditions, myths, heroes, and ancient culture that shaped who we truly are as a nation long before the regime existed.

🔥 2. Our Reality
A clear, uncensored record of the crimes committed by the Islamic Republic regime against the people of Iran — so no life, no name, and no injustice is ever forgotten.

Together, they remind us of something essential:
We had an identity before this regime. And we will have one long after it.

This app is built anonymously, by Iranians who chose truth over fear — people who want every user to feel the pride of being Iranian and the responsibility of remembering those who fought, suffered, or were silenced.

If you’re here, you’re part of that mission too.

This isn’t just a calendar.
It’s a quiet act of resistance.
A tribute to our heritage.
A reminder of our collective strength.
And a small step toward the Iran we deserve.
